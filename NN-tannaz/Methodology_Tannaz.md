4. Model Training
The network was trained for 200 epochs with a batch size of 16, using 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation. Key training configurations:
•	Training Loss (MSE): Stabilized at a low value, indicating effective learning.
•	Validation Loss (MSE): Closely tracked the training loss, suggesting minimal overfitting.
The model demonstrated convergence during training, achieving consistent performance on validation data.

5. Synthetic Data Generation
After training, the network was used to generate synthetic spatial data:
1.	Input Generation:
o	Randomly sampled uniform inputs mimic the transformed distribution of the original data.
2.	Prediction:
o	The trained network produces outputs corresponding to the synthetic spatial coordinates.
3.	Inverse Transformation:
o	The QuantileTransformer reverses the transformation applied during preprocessing, ensuring the synthetic data matches the original frequency distribution.
Synthetic data columns:
•	D_ORIXCOOR, D_ORIYCOOR, D_DESTXCOOR, D_DESTYCOOR.

6. Dynamic Filtering and Frequency Distribution Comparison
To validate the quality of synthetic data:
1.	Dynamic Filtering:
o	Original and synthetic data are filtered based on the 5th and 95th percentiles of the original data for each column.
o	This ensures a focus on the most relevant ranges while excluding extreme outliers.
2.	Frequency Distribution Comparison:
o	Histograms of original and synthetic data are compared for each column.
o	Plots show close alignment between the original and synthetic distributions, demonstrating the network’s ability to reproduce realistic data patterns.
Example comparison for D_ORIXCOOR:
•	Original and synthetic distributions align well, confirming the preservation of frequency characteristics.
